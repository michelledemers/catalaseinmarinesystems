## Catalase in *Alteromonas*
This repo contains raw data for Goldberg et al., 2026, which includes a survey of catalase in Alteromonas. Hannah Goldberg conducted a larger search, but this repo just contains information on the search in Altermonas.

### BlastResults

The folder contains blast output that is used as well as the resulting processed files for our first search in this subject, which just used blast to search for the genes. This isn't super robust, so it isn't what is in the final paper.

### HMMs

This folder contains HMMsearch scripts and output that is used as well as the resulting processed files for our second search in this subject. This is what is in the final paper.

### TreeFiles

Tree files include the concatenated proteins, the script used to make the concatenated proteins from the alteromonas digital organism, the tree making script, the output tree, and the midpoint rooted output tree.

### Metadata

The folder includes the completion/contamination statistics and naming conventions for each genome.
